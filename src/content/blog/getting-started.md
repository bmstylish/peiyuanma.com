I’m building a cybersecurity portfolio by doing the boring-but-important work: setting up systems, breaking them safely, and writing down what I learned.

This post is a snapshot of my lab right now and where it’s going next.

## Current setup

* **Ubuntu server** (home mini-PC)
* Basic hardening (SSH + firewall)
* Simple monitoring + alerts to Discord
* A repo that stores configs safely (no secrets committed)

## Why I’m starting here

Before running vulnerable machines or CTF platforms, I want:

1. A stable base server I can trust
2. Repeatable deployment steps
3. Visibility when something breaks

## Next steps

* Add a reverse proxy and organize multiple services cleanly
* Publish small, repeatable labs (writeups first)
* Connect server to a discord bot for easier access
* Fully complete the static website, with easy access to blog posting/editing 

If you’re also learning: start small, document everything, and make your setup observable.
